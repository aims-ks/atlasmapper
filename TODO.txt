[X] Reduce noise in logs
        Reduced from 20,000 to about 200. Will reduce more after implementing H2 cache
[X] Handle internet failure better (continue when Internet comes back)
        Upgraded HttpClient
        Repeat request on failure after 5 sec delay
[X] Stop button
    [X] Make my own InterruptException implements Throwable (instead of Exception) to make it harder to catch
    [X] Disable generate button when running
            I can't disable the icon. Seems to be a bug in ExtJS.
            Instead, I bring the log window when someone click the generate button and it's already running.
    [X] When done, enable generate, disable Stop button
[X] Update JUnit
[X] Bring logs window back (generate button changes into loading icon)
[X] Remove Generate all

[ ] Deploy 2.0.0 in http://atlasmapper.org/

[X] H2 cache (https://github.com/atlasmapper/atlasmapper/issues/115)
    [X] Do not show multiple warning / error for the same URL
            Make a public isDownloadRequired and use it everywhere to tell the user what is about to be downloaded
            The app decide what to do depending on the status. The cache doesn't log anything, the app does before requesting download or whatever.
    [X] Return file even when status code is 500 (TC211Parser.java line 93) - NOTE: Multiple layers may share same metadata URL (do not retry URL for a given time?)
    [ ] Craft Mest URL for New and Old GeoNetwork (using configurable array of templates? Not everyone does proper server side redirections)
    [X] Level of logging with cache (we could log error for TC211 docs as DEBUG to reduce noise in User log window)

    [ ] Use a different DB for location search
