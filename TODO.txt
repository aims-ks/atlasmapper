[X] Reduce noise in logs
        Reduced from 20,000 to about 200. Will reduce more after implementing H2 cache
[X] Handle internet failure better (continue when Internet comes back)
        Upgraded HttpClient
        Repeat request on failure after 5 sec delay
[X] Stop button
    [X] Make my own InterruptException implements Throwable (instead of Exception) to make it harder to catch
    [X] Disable generate button when running
            I can't disable the icon. Seems to be a bug in ExtJS.
            Instead, I bring the log window when someone click the generate button and it's already running.
    [X] When done, enable generate, disable Stop button
[X] Update JUnit
[X] Bring logs window back (generate button changes into loading icon)
[X] Remove Generate all

[ ] H2 cache
[ ] Do not show multiple warning / error for the same URL
[ ] Keep returned file even when status code is 500 (TC211Parser.java line 93) - NOTE: Multiple layers may share same metadata URL (do not retry URL for a given time?)
[ ] Craft Mest URL for New and Old GeoNetwork (using configurable array of templates? Not everyone does proper server side redirections)
[ ] Level of logging with cache (we could log error for TC211 docs as DEBUG)
