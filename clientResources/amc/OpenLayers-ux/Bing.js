/**
 * This method is a copy of OpenLayers 2.12.
 * The modification, removing the protocol from the URL, fixes issue with
 *     browsers (Google Chrome) that has problem loading http resources in
 *     a https page.
 * The fix has been integrated into the OpenLayers core, so it is safe to
 *     remove it with the next release of OpenLayers (2.13+).
 * Issue: https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/699
 * Patch: https://github.com/fredj/ol3/commit/c38889955c2f53eb9e78b7c7930233935db10b90
